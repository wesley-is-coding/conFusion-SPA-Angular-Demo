# conFusion-SPA-Angular-Demo
This is a single page application for a restaurant built using AngularJS.  It stars the wonderful Professor Muppala.

It demonstrates the use of Angular and the $resource service as well as the router-ui functionality in a typical app/service/controller model.

Further instructions for how to set up a server demo will be included in the future.
